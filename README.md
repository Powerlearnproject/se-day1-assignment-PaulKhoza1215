#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C). 
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall uses a  Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile uses Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
In a Project Management scenario, Waterfall methodologies tend to be structured and predictable, whereas Agile methodologies are flexible and adaptable. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, Tight deadlines and Technical debt. 
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems. 
System Testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts (inputs) for large language models (LLMs) to elicit desired outputs. It involves crafting specific instructions, questions, or examples to guide the AI towards generating accurate, relevant, and useful responses.
Its Importance includes Controlling Output, Improving Accuracy and Relevance, Unlocking Advanced Capabilities, Enhancing User Experience and Reproducibility amongst other things. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
When a prompt lacks context, doesn't specify the type of writing (story, poem, factual description) and It doesn't define the desired length or tone.
To Improve it It now specifies the type of writing (story) It is Specific in that It defines the genre (humorous), subject (cat locking owner out), and approximate length (150 words) and it is now Concise in that It delivers all necessary information in a direct and efficient way.
The improved prompt eliminates ambiguity and provides the AI with the necessary guidance to generate a more targeted and useful response.
